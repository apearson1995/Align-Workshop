    " Making a tree from the pairwise distances is significantly more complicated of a task.  But fortunately a lot of very smart people have been thinking about this problem for a very long time, and they have developed a lot of very good algorithms to solve this problem.  One of the many algorithms used to do this is the \"UPGMA\" algorithm. Although \"UPGMA\" was not the Algorithm used by the investigators of the HIV dentist mystery, it is close enough of an approximation for the purposes of this workshop, and is a pre-requisite for understanding more sophisticated methods.\n",
